[{"content":"Since its inception in 2001, the CMNA workshop series has focused upon the issue of modelling “natural” argumentation, where naturalness may range across a variety of forms, perhaps involving the use of visual rather than linguistic means to illustrate a point, for example using graphics or multimedia, or applying more sophisticated rhetorical devices, interacting at various layers of abstraction, or exploiting \u0026ldquo;extra-rational\u0026rdquo; characteristics of the audience, taking into account emotions and affective factors.\nAI has witnessed a prodigious growth in uses of argumentation throughout many of its subdisciplines:\nagent system negotiation protocols that demonstrate higher levels of sophistication and robustness; argumentation-based models of evidential relations and legal processes that are more expressive; groupwork tools that use argument to structure interaction and debate; computer-based learning tools that exploit monological and dialogical argument structures in designing pedagogic environments; decision support systems that build upon argumentation theoretic models of deliberation to better integrate with human reasoning; and models of knowledge engineering structured around core concepts of argument to simplify knowledge elicitation and representation problems. Furthermore, benefits have not been unilateral for AI, as demonstrated by the increasing presence of AI scholars in classical argumentation theory events and journals, and AI implementations of argument finding application in both research and pedagogic practice within philosophy and argumentation theory.\n","permalink":"https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna25/about/","summary":"Since its inception in 2001, the CMNA workshop series has focused upon the issue of modelling “natural” argumentation, where naturalness may range across a variety of forms, perhaps involving the use of visual rather than linguistic means to illustrate a point, for example using graphics or multimedia, or applying more sophisticated rhetorical devices, interacting at various layers of abstraction, or exploiting \u0026ldquo;extra-rational\u0026rdquo; characteristics of the audience, taking into account emotions and affective factors.","title":"About CMNA"},{"content":" Updated Paper Submission Deadline (long \u0026amp; short papers): 15th July 2024 Regular Paper submission (long \u0026amp; short papers): 8th July 2024 Review Period: 9th July 2024 \u0026ndash; 1st August 2024 Notification to authors: 13th August 2024 Demo, poster, \u0026amp; late breaking results submission (2 page abstract): 13th August 2024 Demo, poster, \u0026amp; late breaking results Notification to authors: 20th August 2024 Final (Camera Ready) version of papers: 27th August 2024 Workshop: 17th September 2024 ","permalink":"https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna25/dates/","summary":" Updated Paper Submission Deadline (long \u0026amp; short papers): 15th July 2024 Regular Paper submission (long \u0026amp; short papers): 8th July 2024 Review Period: 9th July 2024 \u0026ndash; 1st August 2024 Notification to authors: 13th August 2024 Demo, poster, \u0026amp; late breaking results submission (2 page abstract): 13th August 2024 Demo, poster, \u0026amp; late breaking results Notification to authors: 20th August 2024 Final (Camera Ready) version of papers: 27th August 2024 Workshop: 17th September 2024 ","title":"Dates"},{"content":" [2024.10.28] CEUR proceedings published.

Please submit your papers, demos, and posters via CMT using the following link:\nCMT submission link Workshop Categories The workshop encourages submissions spanning a number of categories:\nLong papers, either reporting on completed work or offering a polemic discussion on a burning issue (up to 10 pages). Short papers describing work in progress (up to 5 pages). Demos (2 page abstract describing the demo) Posters (2 page abstract explaining the concept behind the poster). Late breaking results (2 page abstract reporting the results). All accepted submissions will be archived locally on this site. Long \u0026amp; short papers will also be archved through CEUR workshop proceedings. Demos \u0026amp; posters will only be archived locally.\nIt is highly recommended, but not mandatory, to format papers using the CEUR Single Column Style (more details below in the style section).\nContribution Style For final proceedings submission we\u0026rsquo;ll use the CEUR styles specifically the single column style from this page. It is recommended that you prepare your submission for review using this style.\nIf the following don\u0026rsquo;t download automatically then please right click on the required link and select \u0026ldquo;save link as\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; from the pop-up menu.\nFor LaTeX users: Use the Overleaf CEUR LaTeX template or download the zip archive for offline LaTeX compilation. For Open Document Format users: ODT Template For Word Users: DOCX Template Pre-Proceedings Publication We\u0026rsquo;ve gotten into the habit recently of publishing pre-proceedings shortly before the workshop so that folk can attend having prepared for the workshop, knowing what to expect, and being ready to engage with the presented work. So we plan to publish proceedings for CMNA 24 through CEUR Workshop Proceedings as has happened in previous years.\nPost-Proceedings Publication This year, in addition to our regular topics we are organising CMNA with the special theme of \u0026ldquo;domains of natural argument\u0026rdquo;. Contributions to this theme will form the focus of a subsequent, post-workshop, special issue of the Journal of Argument \u0026amp; Computation. Extended papers will be solicited in a special issue call immediately after the CMNA workshop.\n","permalink":"https://cmna-workshop.github.io/cmna25/submission/","summary":"Considering a submission to CMNA?

How do they relate to features of other specialist domains or “everyday” argumentation? How can study of natural argument in a particular domain inform models of natural argument in other domains? How are classical models of natural argument and domain-specific models related to each other? Contributions to this theme will be invited to submit extended work to a special issue of the Journal of Argument \u0026amp; Computation.\nRegular Topics The CMNA workshop series focuses on the general issue of modelling \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; argumentation.\nContributions are solicited addressing, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:\nThe characteristics of “natural” arguments (e.g. ontological aspects, cognitive issues, legal aspects). The linguistic characteristics of natural argumentation, including discourse markers, sentence format, referring expressions, and style. The generation of natural argument Corpus argumentation results and techniques Argumentation mining Models of natural legal argument Rhetoric and affect: the role of emotions, personalities, etc. in argumentation. The roles of licentiousness and deceit and the ethical implications of implemented systems demonstrating such features. Natural argumentation in multi-agent systems. Methods to better convey the structure of complex argument, including representation and summarisation. Natural argumentation and media: visual arguments, multi-modal arguments, spoken arguments. Evaluative arguments and their application in AI systems (such as decision-support and advice-giving). Non-monotonic, defeasible and uncertain argumentation. The computational use of models from informal logic and argumentation theory. Computer supported collaborative argumentation, for pedagogy, e-democracy and public debate. Tools for interacting with structures of argument. Applications of argumentation based systems.
