# Special Theme

To celebrate this landmark year, we solicit contributions on the special theme of:

**“Reflections & Horizons: The past 25 years of Computational Models of Natural Argument and visions of things to come”**. 

This theme should be interpreted broadly, to reflect the wide range of argumentative practices and models that have been studied and shared at CMNA. We also encourage reflection on the development of argumentation theory within the remit of CMNA during the last 25 years. Finally we also encourage forward looking contributions that share a vision of how argumentation research might develop over the next quarter century.

# Regular Topics

The CMNA workshop series focuses on the general issue of modelling "natural" argumentation.

 Contributions are solicited addressing, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:

* The characteristics of “natural” arguments (e.g. ontological aspects, cognitive issues, legal aspects).
* The linguistic characteristics of natural argumentation, including discourse markers, sentence format, referring expressions, and style.
* The generation of natural argument.
* Corpus argumentation results and techniques.
* Argumentation mining.
* Models of natural legal argument.
* Rhetoric and affect: the role of emotions, personalities, etc. in argumentation.
* The roles of licentiousness and deceit and the ethical implications of implemented systems demonstrating such features.
* Natural argumentation in multi-agent systems.
* Methods to better convey the structure of complex argument, including representation and summarisation.
* Natural argumentation and media: visual arguments, multi-modal arguments, spoken arguments.
* Evaluative arguments and their application in AI systems (such as decision-support and advice-giving).
* Non-monotonic, defeasible and uncertain argumentation.
* The computational use of models from informal logic and argumentation theory.
* Computer supported collaborative argumentation, for pedagogy, e-democracy and public debate.
* Tools for interacting with structures of argument.
* Applications of argumentation based systems.
