# Considering a submission to CMNA?

We pride ourselves on operating CMNA as a "broad church" and aiming for inclusiveness so if you're unsure of whether CMNA is a good fit for your work you can:

1. [contact](/cmna24/organisation/) a member of the organising committee, or 
2. explore our archives at the [CMNA.info](http://cmna.info) site or 
3. survey a selection of papers from the CEUR archive of previous CMNA workshops:
    * [Volume #3614 (CMNA'23)](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3614/),

The workshop encourages submissions spanning a number of categories:

* Short papers describing work in progress (up to 5 pages).
* Demos (2 page abstract describing the demo)

All accepted submissions will be archived locally on this site. Long & short papers will also be archved through CEUR workshop proceedings. Demos & posters will only be archived locally.

It is highly recommended, but not mandatory, to format papers using the [CEUR Single Column Style](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/) (more details below in the style section). 

# Contribution Style 

For final proceedings submission we'll use the [CEUR styles](https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/) specifically the single column style from [this page](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/).

# Pre-Proceedings Publication

We've gotten into the habit recently of publishing pre-proceedings shortly before the workshop so that folk can attend having prepared for the workshop, knowing what to expect, and being ready to engage with the presented work. So we plan to publish proceedings for CMNA 24 through [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](http://ceur-ws.org/) as has happened in previous years. 

# Post-Proceedings Publication

<!--Periodically we publish a collection of papers from recent CMNA events. It is coming time to do so again...-->
This year, in addition to our regular [topics](/cmna24/topics/) we are organising CMNA with the special theme of "[domains of natural argument](/cmna24/topics/#special-theme)". Contributions to this theme will form the focus of a subsequent, post-workshop, special issue of the Journal of Argument & Computation. Extended papers will be solicited in a special issue call immediately after the CMNA workshop.
